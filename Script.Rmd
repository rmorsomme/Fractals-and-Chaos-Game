# Introduction
In this script, I implement the so-called *choas game* to generate fractals. I decided to write this script after watching a tutorial video by Numberphile on the topic. I found the chaos game fascinating and wanted to implement it on R Studio. I also wanted to generalize this method to be able to generate other types of fractals.

## Fractals
Fractals are complex mathematical objects. In this script, it is sufficient to understand them as geometric figures whose parts are reduced-size copies of the whole. That is, given a fractal, if we zoom in on any part, we find the exact same patterns as in the original figure, no matter how much we zoom in. One of the most famous fractals in mathematics is the Sierpinski Triangle.

## The Choas Game
The 8-minute <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs>[tutorial *Chaos Game* by Numberphile] does a much better job at explaining the choas game than I could possibly do, so I recommend the reader to simply watch it to understand how the method works. To generate the Sierpinski Gasket with the chaos game, we follow 5 steps:

1. Take three points in a plane. These will be the vertices of the final fractal.
2. Choose a point in the plane and draw it.
3. Randomly choose a vertex.
4. Draw the point half distance between the current point and the chosen vertex.
5. Repeat from step 3.

## Outline of Script
I kick off this script with a well-know fractal: the Sierpinski Gasket. I write a function that uses the chaos game to generate it and then experiment with the parameters to vary the shape of and the patterns in the obtained fractal. I then generalize the function to generate fractals with any number of vertices before finishing the script with an adaptation of the chaos game that generates Barnsley Fern, another beautiful fractal.

# Sierpinski Gasket and Other Triangular Fractals

## The Function
We design a function `generate_sg()` that uses the chaos game to generate a Sierpinski Gasket. The function has the following arguments:

* `n` determines the number of iterations. A large `n` produces a figure with a sharper pattern.

* `v1`, `v2` and `v3` determine the coordinates of the three vertices of the fractal. Their default values produce a equilateral triangle.

* `p` determines the location of the new point on the line segment between the previous point and the chosen vertex. Note that `p` must be comprised between `0` and `1`; a small value indicates that the new point is close to the selected vertex, and a value close to `1` indicates that the new point is close to the previous one.

* `initial_point` indicates the location of the initial point.

* `title` is the title of the graph. If let to `NULL`, the figure has no title.

* `subtitle` is the subtitle of the graph. If let to `NULL`, the figure has no subtitle.

```{r generate_sg}
generate_sg <- function(n = 1e4, v1 = c(0,0), v2 = c(1, 0), v3 = c(0.5, sqrt(3)/2),
                        p = 0.5, initial_point = v1, title = NULL, subtitle = NULL){
  
  points <- data.frame(x = NA, y = NA)
  
  point_previous <- initial_point
  
  for(i in 1:n){
    
    vertex         <- sample(list(v1, v2, v3), size = 1)[[1]]
    point_new      <- p       * point_previous +
                      (1 - p) * vertex
    
    points[i, ]    <- point_new
    
    point_previous <- point_new
    
  }
  
  g <- ggplot(points, aes(x, y)) +
    geom_point(shape = ".") +
    labs(title = title, subtitle = subtitle) + 
    theme_void() +
    theme(plot.title    = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
          plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
  
  ggsave(paste("Triangular Fractal with p =", p, ".jpeg"),
         width = 4, height = 2 * sqrt(3), path = "Plots")
  return(g)
  
}
```

The loop of `generate_sg` can be simplified in the following way to speed up the function.

```{r generate_sg fast}
generate_sg <- function(n = 1e4, v1 = c(0,0), v2 = c(1, 0), v3 = c(0.5, sqrt(3)/2), 
                        p = 0.5, initial_point = v1, title = NULL, subtitle = NULL){
  
  points      <- data.frame(x = NA, y = NA)
  points[1, ] <- initial_point
  
  for(i in 1 : n)  points[i + 1, ] <- p       * points[i, ] +
                                      (1 - p) * sample(list(v1, v2, v3), size = 1)[[1]]

  g <- ggplot(points, aes(x, y)) +
    geom_point(shape = ".") +
    labs(title = title, subtitle = subtitle) + 
    theme_void() +
    theme(plot.title    = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
          plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
  
  ggsave(paste("Triangular Fractal with p =", p, ".jpeg"),
         width = 4, height = 2 * sqrt(3), path = "Plots")
  return(g)
  
}
```

With its arguments left to their defaults values, the function generates the Sierpinski Gasket.

```{r sg default, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 3, fig.align = 'center', cache = TRUE}
generate_sg()
```


## Other Triangular Fractals
We can design triangular fractals with various shapes and patterns by varying the values of the parameters of `generate_sg()`. First, by changing the value of `p`, we generate fractals with different patterns.

```{r sg p, fig.height = 1, fig.width = 2, fig.align = 'center', cache = TRUE}
for(p in c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95))
  print(generate_sg(p = p, subtitle = paste("p =", p)))
```

It seems that for `p` superior to `0.5`, larger values give figures that are more chaotic. 

Then, we can also randomly determine the location of the vertices to obtain different triangular figures.

```{r sg v, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 3, fig.align = 'center', cache = TRUE}
set.seed(123)
generate_sg(v1 = runif(2), v2 = runif(2), v3 = runif(2))
set.seed(124)
generate_sg(v1 = runif(2), v2 = runif(2), v3 = runif(2))
set.seed(125)
generate_sg(v1 = runif(2), v2 = runif(2), v3 = runif(2))
```

Note that increasing the number of iterations generates a figure with a sharper pattern, but takes more time to run.

```{r sg n, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 3, fig.align = 'center', cache = TRUE}
set.seed(125)
generate_sg(v1 = runif(2), v2 = runif(2), v3 = runif(2),
            n = 1e5)
```

Also note that changing the location of the initial point does not significantly alter the outcome: the sequence of points rapidly follows the regular pattern.

```{r sg i_p, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 3, fig.align = 'center', cache = TRUE}
set.seed(125)
generate_sg(v1 = runif(2), v2 = runif(2), v3 = runif(2),
            initial_point = c(3, 3))
```


# General Formula

## The Function
One could also be interested in generating fractals with more vertices. The function `generate_fractal()` is a generalization of `generate_sg()` that can generate fractals with any number of vertices. It has the same arguments as `generate_sg()` at the exception of:

* `k` determines the number of vertices of the fractal.

* `x` and `y` determine the x- and y-coordinates of the fractal's vertices. If the arguments `x` and `y` are left to `NULL`, then the coordinates are randomly generated.

```{r generate_fractal}
generate_fractal <- function(n = 1e4, k = 4, x = NULL, y = NULL, p = 0.5, title = NULL, subtitle = NULL){
  
  if(is.null(x)){ x <- runif(k)}
  if(is.null(y)){ y <- runif(k)}
  
  points <- data.frame(x = NA, y = NA)
  
  point <- c(x[1], y[1])
  
  for(i in 1:n){
    
    m      <- sample(1 : length(x), size = 1)
    vertex <- c(x[m], y[m])
    point  <- p       * point +
              (1 - p) * vertex
    
    points[i, ] <- point
    
  }
  
  g <- ggplot(points, aes(x, y)) +
    geom_point(shape = ".") +
    labs(title = title, subtitle = subtitle) + 
    theme_void() +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
          plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
    
  ggsave(paste("k =", k, "and p =", p, ".jpeg"), width = 4, height = 4, path = "Plots")
  return(g)
  
}
```

## Experimenting

With its parameters left to their default value, the function generates a quadrilateral figure with its vertices randomly located.

```{r fractal default, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 3, fig.align = 'center', cache = TRUE}
set.seed(123)
generate_fractal()
```

By fixing the vertices, we can generate a square fractal.
```{r fractal square, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 2, fig.align = 'center', cache = TRUE}
generate_fractal(x = c(0,0,1,1), y = c(0,1,0,1))
```

Surprisingly, unlike the previous quadrilateral figure, the square fractal does not contain any clear pattern. Yet, once again, by varying the value of `p` we can change the patterns in the obtained figure.

```{r fractal p, fig.height = 1, fig.width = 1, fig.align = 'center', cache = TRUE}
for(p in c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.45, 0.49, 0.5, 0.55, 0.7, 0.9))
  print(generate_fractal(x = c(0,0,1,1), y = c(0,1,0,1),     
                         p = p, subtitle = paste("p =", p)))
```

It seems that for square fractals, values of `p` equal or superior to `0.5` generates figures with no apparent pattern.

Changing the value of the argument `k` will generate fractals with different numbers of vertices.

```{r fractal k, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 3, fig.align = 'center', cache = TRUE}
ks    <- c(3  , 4   , 5  , 7   )
seeds <- c(1  , 12  , 121, 241 )
ps    <- c(0.5, 0.45, 0.4, 0.35)

for(i in 1:length(ks)){
  
  k    <- ks[i]
  seed <- seeds[i]
  p    <- ps[i]
  
  set.seed(seed)
  
  print(generate_fractal(k = k, p = p,
                         title    = paste("Fractal with", k, "Vertices"),
                         subtitle = paste("p =", p)))

}
```

# Bonus: Barnsley Fern
I want to conclude this script with an adaptation of the chaos game that generates the so-called Barnsley Fern (in my opinion one of the most beautiful fractals there is.). Note how each leaf of the fern is a fern itself.

</center>

## The Function
The function `generate_bf()` uses an adaptation of the chaos game to generate a Barnsley Fern. The underlying iterative mechanism of `generate_bf()` is fundamentally the same as that of `generate_fractal()` and `generate_sg()`: given a point, we randomly apply to its coordinates a transformation from a given set of transformations to generate the next point. For the function `generate_bf()`, we apply one of `4` affine transformations to the point's coordinates. These four transformation are captured in the four rows of the matrices `M1` and `M2`. I obtained the values for the entries of these matrices from Mr. Barnsley's book `Fractals Everywhere` (p.86, table III.3. *IFS code for a fern*). For clarity, I decided to split the table from Mr. Barnsley's book into two matrices.

* `n` determines the number of iterations.

* `proba` gives the probability of applying each of the `4` transformations to the point. Each transformation has an associated element on the plot: the stem, the leaves' end, the fern's left-hand side and the fern's right-hand side.

* `title` is the title of the graph. If let to `NULL`, the figure has no title.

* `subtitle` is the subtitle of the graph. If let to `NULL`, the figure has no subtitle.

```{r, generate_bf}
generate_bf <- function(n = 1e4, proba = c(0.01, 0.85, 0.07, 0.07), title = NULL, subtitle = NULL){
  
  M1 <- matrix(c(0    , 0    , 0    , 0.16,
                 0.85 , 0.04 , -0.04, 0.85,
                 0.20 , -0.26, 0.23 , 0.22,
                 -0.15, 0.28 , 0.26 , 0.24), byrow = T, ncol = 4)

  M2 <- matrix(c(0, 0   ,
                 0, 1.60,
                 0, 1.60,
                 0, 0.44), byrow = T, ncol = 2)
  
  points <- data.frame(x = NA, y = NA)
  
  point <- c(0,0)
  
  
  for(i in 1:n){
    
    k           <- sample(1 : 4, size = 1, prob = proba)
    point       <- matrix(M1[k, ], byrow = T, ncol = 2) %*% point + M2[k, ]
    points[i, ] <- point
    
  }
  
  g <- ggplot(points, aes(x, y)) +
    geom_point(shape = ".") +
    labs(title = title, subtitle = subtitle) + 
    theme_void() +
    theme(plot.title    = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
          plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
    
  
  ggsave("Barnsley Fern.jpeg", width = 3, height = 3, path = "Plots")
  return(g)
  
}
```

With its parameters left to their default value, the function generates Barnsley Fern.

```{r bf default, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 3, fig.align = 'center'}
generate_bf()
```

## Experimenting
Changing the probabilities in `proba` changes the distribution of the points among the different elements of the fern (stem, leaves' end, and left- and right-hand sides). If we set one of the elements of `proba` to `0`, it leaves the associated element of the fern blank.

```{r bf proba I, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4.8, fig.align = 'center', cache = TRUE}

proba     <- c(0.01, 0.85, 0.07, 0.07)
subtitles <- c("1st element of `proba` is null: blank stem"           ,
               "2nd element of `proba` is null: no result",
               "3rd element of `proba` is null: blank left-hand side",
               "4th element of `proba` is null: blank right-hand side")

for(i in 1:4){
  
  proba_blank    <- proba
  proba_blank[i] <- 0
  subtitle       <- subtitles[i]
  
  print(generate_bf(proba    = proba_blank,
                    title    = "Barnsley Fern",
                    subtitle = subtitle))
  
}
```

On the contrary, if we increase the value of an element of `proba`, we make the associated element of the fern more pronounced.

```{r bf proba II, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4.8, fig.align = 'center', cache = TRUE}
m <- 3
proba     <- c(0.01, 0.85, 0.07, 0.07)
subtitles <- c("1st element of `proba` is increased: stem more pronounced"           ,
               "2nd element of `proba` is increased: leaves' ends more pronounced"  ,
               "3rd element of `proba` is increased: left-hand side more pronounced",
               "4th element of `proba` is increased: right-hand side more pronounced")

for(i in 1:4){
  
  proba_blank    <- proba
  proba_blank[i] <- proba_blank[i] * m
  subtitle       <- subtitles[i]
  
  print(generate_bf(proba    = proba_blank,
                    title    = "Barnsley Fern",
                    subtitle = subtitle))
  
}
```

# Summary
I designed three functions `generate_sg()`, `generate_fractal()` and `generate_bf()` that respectively generate the Sierpinski Gasket, fractals with any number of vertices and the Barnsley Fern. Each function has parameters that allow us to tweak the shape of and pattern in the obtained fractal. Most important is the argument `p` of the functions `generate_sg` and `generate_fractal` which determines whether the figure is a fractal with a clear pattern or a bunch of points located in a chaotic manner.
