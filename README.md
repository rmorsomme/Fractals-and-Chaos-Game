# Fractals-and-Chaos-Game
Generating fractals with the so-called chaos game


In this script, I implement the so-called *choas game* to generate fractals.
I decided to write this script after watching a tutorial video by Numberphile on the topic. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs)
I found the chaos game fascinating and wanted to implement it on R.
I also wanted to generalize this method to be able to generate other types of fractal.

The folder Plots contains the figures generated in the script.
